# travelTimeDB

Putting seismic wave travel-time information into a sqlite3 database.

More information on my website at https://carlulberg.com/travel-time-sql/

- The travelTimeDB ipython notebook is a first attempt that uses  python to massage the data before ultimately putting into a sqlite database.
- The travelTimeDB_sql notebook uses a bit of python to put the text files directly into a sqlite database, then contains notes on sql commands I used in the command window to further manipulate the data in sql
